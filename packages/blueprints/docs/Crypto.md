## What Does It Do?

### Creates Hashes

A hash is like a unique fingerprint for a piece of information. This Blueprint can create these fingerprints for you.

### Uses Different Algorithms

You can choose from different algorithms like "SHA256" or "SHA3-512." These are like different types of locks, each with its unique strength.

### Handles Different Types of Information

Whether you have numbers, text, or more complex information, this Blueprint knows how to handle it.

### Tells You the Result

Once it creates the hash, it will tell you the result. If something goes wrong, like if it can't create the hash, it will let you know what happened.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Reads Your Instructions:** It looks at the algorithm, encoding, and information you gave it.
2. **Creates the Hash:** It takes your information and creates the hash using the options you chose.
3. **Tells You the Result:** It comes back and tells you the hash or if there was a problem.
