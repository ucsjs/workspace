# MongoDB

## What Is This?

This Blueprint is like a set of instructions that helps our system communicate with a MongoDB database. MongoDB is a place where we can store and organize information, like a digital filing cabinet.

## Blueprint Properties

Here are the properties that the Blueprint uses to connect to MongoDB:

- **Name:** The name of the connection.
- **Connection String:** The full address to connect to MongoDB.
- **Protocol:** The type of connection, such as "mongodb" or "mongodb+srv."
- **Hostname:** The address of the database.
- **Port:** The port to connect to the database.
- **Username:** The username to access the database.
- **Password:** The password to access the database.
- **Database:** The name of the specific database.
- **Replica:** The name of the replica set, if any.
- **TLS:** Whether the connection should be secure (true or false).
