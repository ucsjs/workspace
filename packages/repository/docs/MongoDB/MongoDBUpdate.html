<h3>Updates Specific Things</h3>
<p>You can tell this Blueprint exactly what you want to update, like “change the color of all the red folders to blue,” and it will go into the filing cabinet and make those changes for you.</p>
<h3>Understands What to Update</h3>
<p>You can give it specific instructions (called a query) about what to update, and it will understand exactly what you mean.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Update:</strong> If you want to update just one thing, it can do that.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Update:</strong> If you want to update multiple things at once, it can handle that too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tells You the Result</h3>
<p>Once it’s done updating, it will tell you if it was successful. If something goes wrong, like if it can’t find the files you asked about, it will let you know what happened.</p>
