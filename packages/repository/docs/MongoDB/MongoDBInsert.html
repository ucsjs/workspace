<h3>Inserts Specific Things</h3>
<p>You can tell this Blueprint exactly what you want to insert, like “add these new blue folders,” and it will go into the filing cabinet and put them in the right place for you.</p>
<h3>Understands What to Insert</h3>
<p>You can give it specific instructions (called a query) about what to insert, and it will understand exactly what you mean.</p>
<h3>Tells You the Result</h3>
<p>Once it’s done inserting, it will tell you if it was successful. If something goes wrong, like if it can’t find the right drawer to put the files in, it will let you know what happened.</p>
