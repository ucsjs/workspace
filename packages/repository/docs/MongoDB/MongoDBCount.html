<h3>Counts Specific Things</h3>
<p>You can tell this Blueprint what you want to count, like “all the red folders,” and it will go into the filing cabinet and count them for you.</p>
<h3>Understands What to Count</h3>
<p>You can give it specific instructions (called a query) about what to count, and it will understand exactly what you mean.</p>
<h3>Tells You the Result</h3>
<p>Once it’s done counting, it will tell you the number. If something goes wrong, like if it can’t find the drawer you asked about, it will let you know what happened.</p>
