# Blueprints

Blueprints are a key feature of the Unreal Engine, a popular game engine used in the development of games and other interactive applications. Blueprints provide a visual programming system that allows you to create game logic and interactions without having to write code in traditional programming languages such as C++.

Instead of writing lines of code, Blueprints allow developers to create game scripts using an intuitive GUI. This is done by connecting and configuring a series of nodes and events, forming a visual logic flow. Each node represents a specific action or condition, such as moving a character, playing a sound, or detecting collisions. Nodes are connected to each other to define the order and logic of actions.

Blueprints allow developers and artists to quickly prototype games, test ideas, and iterate on game mechanics. They offer a visual and accessible approach to creating complex game functionality, making it easy for people with no programming experience or limited coding knowledge to create interactive content.

Blueprints are highly flexible and can be used to create anything from small interactive elements to full games. They support a wide range of Unreal Engine features including advanced graphics, physics, artificial intelligence, audio and more.

While Blueprints are a powerful tool for game development, they can also be combined with C++ programming. Blueprints can be extended and supplemented with custom code, allowing seamless integration between visual logic and traditional programming as needed.

Blueprints play a key role in the Unreal Engine workflow, providing a visual and intuitive way to build complex game interactions and functionality. They are an essential tool for developers and artists who want to bring their ideas to life and create amazing interactive experiences using the Unreal Engine.

# Blueprints in Typescript 

Obviously, it is a great challenge to recreate a system as complex as the one implemented in Unreal Engine in Typescript because the system must be fast, secure and at the same time flexible so that it is possible to create new solutions in a simple and practical way, in addition the system must designed to be extensible through Typescript code created by the project's developers and third parties.

Conceptually, it seems simple to create a system that externalizes small prefabricated components with specific functionalities, but the control of the flow of data that is transmitted from one Blueprint to the other, intercepting and converting data when necessary, allowing the coupling of plugins and the possibility of a chaining to occur. in order not to cause an infinite looping of data, it makes the work very complex and possible for possible exceptions, so the project has the premise of individually carrying out tests on each blueprint before the system becomes available to the general public, and any contribution to the project's repositories must necessarily follow the guidelines provided in this manual in order to avoid future problems that may occur due to implementation failures.

# What is possible ?

In its release version, UCS.js will be possible to create simple applications such as websites, layouts for email, webviews, exportable apps for React Native (https://reactnative.dev/) and Flutter (https://flutter.dev/), more complex implementations of dashboards natively implemented with Material Design (https://m3.material.io/), extendable to any framework on the market such as Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/), Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/), creation of complex native frontends in Javascript or using frameworks with jQuery (https://jquery.com/), Angular (https://angular.io/), React (https://react.dev/) or Vue (https://vuejs.org/), creation of Rest or GraphQL APIs (https://graphql.org/), using several natively implemented services such as MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/), MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/), Redis (https://redis.io/), Memcached (https://memcached.org/), Elastic Search (https://www.elastic.co/), RabbitMQ (https://www.rabbitmq.com/), Apache Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/).

Creating microservices and integrating them through queues in Redis, RabbitMQ and Kafka, or direct communication via Protocol Buffers (https://protobuf.dev/), and FlatBuffers (https://flatbuffers.dev/).

For the Devops part, the UCS will contain a series of tools for testing and publishing in production, such as Kubernets management (https://kubernetes.io/), Docker (https://www.docker.com/), integration with Cloudservers APIs such as AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/), Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/), Azure (https://azure.microsoft.com/), CDN management such as Cloudflare (https://www.cloudflare.com/) and Cloudfront, even applications in serveless as Cloudflare Workers.

UCS will also feature a series of integrations to LLM models with GPT 4 (https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), LLama (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), Alpaca (https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html), Dalai (https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/dalai), Midjourney (https://midjourneyapi.io/) and Stable Diffusion (https://stablediffusionweb.com/) to help with natural language development, procedural image generation, and even the development of new blueprints for the system.

In addition to all the native features planned to be implemented by the UCS development team, we will have a marketplace with thousands of templates, blueprints, models and script developed by the community and provided free of charge or through paid licenses to complement the platform.

Yes, I know it seems ambitious to try implementations, but we believe in the strength of a united and collaborative community, which will complement our development since UCS is a completely Open Source project with no restrictions on use or the need for royalties.
